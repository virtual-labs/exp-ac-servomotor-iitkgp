### About the Experiment 
An a.c. servomotor is an induction motor with two primary windings mutually displaced in magnetic position from one another by 90 electrical degrees.
It has low inertia and high-resistance rotor, thus, giving a speed-torque curve that is linear in shape from no load speed to stand-still.</br>
It is designed for operation with a constant voltage applied to one of the windings , called the fixed phase , while a time-displaced adjustable voltage is impressed on the other winding which is called the control winding.
The two phase induction motor is the most important machine which is used as a servomotor. This is because:<br>
1- No brushes and slip-rings are used. Thus, less maintenance is required and the motor is rugged and robust in construction.<br>
2- The motor requires only a simple control amplifier.<br>
